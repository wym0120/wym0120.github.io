One of the most expensive and time-
onsuming 
omponents
of the debugging pro
ess is lo
ating the errors or faults. To
lo
ate faults, developers must identify statements involved
in failures and sele
t suspi
ious statements that might 
on-
tain faults. This paper presents a new te
hnique that uses
visualization to assist with these tasks. The te
hnique uses

olor to visually map the parti
ipation of ea
h program
statement in the out
ome of the exe
ution of the program
with a test suite, 
onsisting of both passed and failed test

ases. Based on this visual mapping, a user 
an inspe
t
the statements in the program, identify statements involved
in failures, and lo
ate potentially faulty statements. The
paper also des
ribes a prototype tool that implements our
te
hnique along with a set of empiri
al studies that use the
tool for evaluation of the te
hnique. The empiri
al studies
show that, for the sub je
t we studied, the te
hnique 
an be
ee
tive in helping a user lo
ate faults in a program
