### Abstract
> Abstract—Natural languages like English are rich, complex, and powerful. The highly creative and graceful use of languages like English and Tamil, by masters like Shakespeare and Avvai yar, can certainly delight and inspire. But in practice, given cognitive constraints and the exigencies of daily life, most humanutterances are far simpler and much more repetitive and pre dictable. In fact, these utterances can be very usefully modeled using modern statistical methods. This fact has led to the phenomenal success of statistical approaches to speech recognition, natural language translation, question-answering, and text mining and comprehension.

> We begin with the conjecture that most software is also natural, in the sense that it is created by humans at work, with all the attendant constraints and limitations—and thus, like natural language, it is also likely to be repetitive and predictable. Wethen proceed to ask whether a) code can be usefully modeled bystatistical language models and b) such models can be leveragedto support software engineers. Using the widely adoptedn-grammodel, we provide empirical evidence supportive of a positiveanswer to both these questions. We show that code is also veryrepetitive, and in fact even more so than natural languages. Asan example use of the model, we have developed a simple codecompletion engine for Java that, despite its simplicity, alreadyimproves Eclipse’s completion capability. We conclude the paper by laying out a vision for future research in this area.
