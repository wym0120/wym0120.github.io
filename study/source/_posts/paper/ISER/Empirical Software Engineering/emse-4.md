### Abstract
> System logs are widely used in various tasks of software system management. It is crucial to avoid logging too little or toomuch. To achieve so, developers need to make informed decisions on where to log and what to log in their logging practices during development. However, there exists no work on studying such logging practices in industry or helping developers makeinformed decisions. To fill this significant gap, in this paper, wesystematically study the logging practices of developers in industry, with focus on where developers log. We obtain six valuable findings by conducting source code analysis on twolarge industrial systems (2.5M and 10.4M LOC, respectively) at Microsoft. We further validate these findings via aquestionnaire survey with 54 experienced developers in Microsoft. Inaddition, our study demonstrates the high accuracy of up to 90% F-Scorein predicting where to log.
