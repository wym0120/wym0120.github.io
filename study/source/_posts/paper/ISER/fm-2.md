### Abstract
> Verication by state-space exploration, also often referred to as \model checking", is an eective methodfor analyzing the correctness of concurrent reactive systems (e.g., communication protocols). Unfortunately,existing model-checking techniques are restricted to theverication of properties of models, i.e., abstractions, ofconcurrent systems.In this paper, we discuss how model checking can beextended to deal directly with \actual" descriptions ofconcurrent systems, e.g., implementations of communication protocols written in programming languages suchas C or C++. We then introduce a new search technique that is suitable for exploring the state spaces ofsuch systems. This algorithm has been implemented inVeriSoft, a tool for systematically exploring the statespaces of systems composed of several concurrent processes executing arbitrary C code. As an example ofapplication, we describe how VeriSoft successfully dis-covered an error in a 2500-line C program controllingrobots operating in an unpredictable environment.
